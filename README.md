# Takeout Order System

## Overview
This project is a **Takeout Order System** developed as part of a programming assignment. It allows users to browse a restaurant menu, place orders, and receive an itemized receipt. The system ensures accessibility by allowing both numeric and text-based input for item selection.

## Features
- Displays a structured menu with categories and items.
- Users can select menu items by entering numbers or item names.
- Supports multiple item selection at once.
- Validates user input and provides appropriate error messages.
- Prompts users to confirm their order before finalizing.
- Generates an itemized receipt with total pricing.

## Usage
### Running the Program
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your_project
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Ordering Process
- The program displays the menu upon launch.
- Users can enter item numbers (e.g., `1,3,5`) or names (e.g., `burger - chicken`).
- The system asks for quantity confirmation.
- Users can continue adding items or quit by entering `q`.
- The final receipt is displayed.
